# Atmospheric Turbulence Mitigation

To use the provided test program `test_registration.py`, you must first download the [Open Turbulent Image Set (OTIS) Grayscale-PNG Dataset](https://zenodo.org/records/161440). Then, create a directory in the tests folder named "resources", then place the extracted `OTIS_PNG_Gray` folder in the newly created resources directory.

Be sure to use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/blob/main/README.md) when working on this project so all packages are managed correctly.
